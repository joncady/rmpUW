Rate My Professor Chrome Extension for MyPlan

## How to Load
This Chrome extension can be loaded as unpacked extension under the "More tools" -> "Extensions" menu on Chrome.

## More Details
Unforunately, I do not believe I will release it publicly on the Chrome extension "store" because RMP has a history of taking such extensions down. So feel free to share this link, but it would be aweseome if it did not get published. Unless someone knows they will not take it down.

## Technical Info
So this extension actually utilizes one of RMP's "private" APIs to query and get the basic information about the professor and then web scrapes the actual ratings. If you would like to see the back-end code, please get in contact with me! 

Hope you it helps!
